It consists of four articles, which can be read independently. The first one, by the two first named authors, discuss the main application, to some refinement of the André-Pink-Zannier conjecture about closures of subsets of restricted Hecke orbits in Shimura varieties. The second article, by the first and last named author, establishes results about the dynamics of sequences translates of some measures in spaces of -arithmetic lattices. These results are the cornerstone of the methods in the first article. The last two articles, by the first named author, establish results which are crucial for the second article. The third article gives an ultrametric analogue of archimedean results of Richard and Shah, and contains methods of independent interest about stability, Berkovich spaces and Bruhat-Tits buildings. The last article is set in the same context as the second article, and discusses non-divergence of the studied sequences of translates."}],"skills":[{"name":"Mathematics","level":"PhD","icon":"","keywords":["Algebra","Geometry","Number Theory","Dynamics"]}],"languages":[{"language":"French","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"","icon":"","keywords":[""]}],"references":[{"name":"Nimish Shah, Professor, Ohio State University.","reference":"Collaborator."},{"name":"Andrei Yafaev, Professor, University College London.","reference":"Collaborator and Manager (2017-2018 and 2019-2023)."},{"name":"Emmanuel Ullmo, Professor (Univ.
