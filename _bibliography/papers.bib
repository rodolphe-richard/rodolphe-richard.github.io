Number Theory, Volume 09 (2013) no. 02, pp. 517-543), itself an analogue of [2] (William Drexel Duke Hyperbolic distribution problems and half-integral weight Maass forms, Invent. Math., Volume 92 (1988) no. 1, pp. 73-90). It is about “galoisian” equidistribution of an isogeny class of elliptic curves, in the modular curve, but at an ultrametric place. We answer here in the case of non ultrametric invariants: these of elliptic curves with bad reduction. The way chosen here is quantitative through a link with Dirichlet series of Eisenstein series. We show in the end how to apply the equidistribution property to the asymptotic of the local height of the values of modular functions 
\(P\in\mathbb{Q}(j)\) along a isogeny class, under some hypothesis on the poles of \(P\).

We leave the treatment of poles of \(P\) and of an inverse problem, equivalence between heights asymptotic and equidistribution, to a later article. As the case of elliptic curves with good reduction.

Abstract. Several problems in number theory when reformulated in terms of homogenous
dynamics involve study of limiting distributions of translates of algebraically defined
measures on orbits of reductive groups. The general non-divergence and linearization
techniques, in view of Ratner’s measure classification for unipotent flows, reduce such
problems to dynamical questions about linear actions of reductive groups on finitedimensional vector spaces. This article provides general results which resolve these linear
dynamical questions in terms of natural group theoretic or geometric conditions

Our object is the theory of “\(\pi\)-exponentials” Pulita developed in his thesis, generalising Dwork's and Robba's exponentials and extending Matsuda's work:

We start with an abstract algebra statement about the structure of the kernel of iterations of the Frobenius endomorphism on the ring of Witt vectors with coordinates in the ring of integers of an ultrametric extension of \(\mathbf{Q}_p\). 
Provided sufficiently (ramified) roots of unity are available, it is, unexpectedly simply, a principal ideal with respect to an explicit generator essentially given by Pulita's \(\pi\)-exponential. This result is a consequence and a reformulation of core facts of Pulita's theory. It happened to be simpler to prove directly than reformulating Pulita's results.

Its translation in terms of series is very elementary, and gives a criterion for solvability and integrality for \(p\)-adic exponential series of polynomials. We explain how to deduce an explicit formula of their radius of convergence, and even the function radius of convergence. We recover this way, in elementary terms, with a new proof, and important simplifications, an algorithm of Christol based similarly on Pulita's work. One concrete advantage is: one can easily prove rigorous complexity bounds about the implied algorithm from our explicit formula. We also add there and there refinements and observation, notably hinting some of the finer informations that can also given by the algorithm.

One of the appendix produce a computation which gives finer estimates on the coefficients of these series. It should provide useful in proving complexity bounds for various computational use involving these series. It is not apparent yet in the present work, but should be in latter projected developments, the series under consideration are the base object for some exponential sums on finite fields via p-adic approach, namely via rigid cohomology with rank one coefficients.

Convergence radius and coefficients estimates are involved studying the efficiency of computational implementations of these objects. The understanding of convergence radius of \(p\)-adic differential equations is a subject undergoing active developments, and we here provide a fine theoretical and computational study of the simplest of cases.

This initiate a projected series of articles. We start here, with the case of the affine line as a base space, a Witt vectors paradigm. This provides an alternative purely algebraic approach of Pulita's theory; the richness of Witt vectors theory allow suppleness and efficiency in working with \(\pi\)-exponentials, which will prove efficient later in the series.

Abstract 

We prove some equidistribution result on the modular curves: Galois
orbits of modular invariants within a same non CM isogeny class distribute along the
Poincaré measure on the modular curve. As a corollary, the height of the considered
points diverges, recovering a result of Szpiro and Ullmo. To prove such a statement, we
combine galois properties (Serre's theorem on the Galois action on division points) and
ergodic properties (Ratner's theorem on unipotent flows, or rather the equidistribution
of Hecke points). We generalise our method in the setup of Shimura varieties. But in
the latter setup, on of our ingredients rely on some variant of Mumford-Tate conjecture.

This brings us to study, in a second part, some renements of the equidistribution
of Hecke points. Some issues of non-divergences in lattices spaces has then to be dealt
with. Dani-Margulis linearization technique reduces this to some geometric statement.
We provide an answer to this question. In the real case, it is a collaboration with
Nimish Shah. In the p-adic case, we are lead to use the ultrametric geometry recently
developed by Berkovich, together with Bruhat-Tits theory, and more particularly the
recent work of B. Remy, A. Thuillier et A. Werner. We precisely prove

- some decomposition properties in buildings inspired by Mostow decomposition
theorem for symmetric spaces;
-  some convexity properties, on buildings, for analytic functions, in the ultrametric
sense, on the associated group.

We finally illustrate how our results, in combination with D. Kleinbock and G. Tomanov work, and Ratner's theorem, applies to the study of some S-arithmetic problems
in lattices spaces

Abstract. The purpose of this article is to describe and characterize the limit
distributions of translates of a bounded open “piece of orbit” of a reductive
subgroup on a space of S-arithmetic lattices. This is accomplished under a mild
assumption of “analytic stability” on the sequence of translates. It is important
to note however that it is not necessary to assume that the reductive subgroup
or its centralizer are algebraic. Moreover, it is also not necessary to assume that
the initial orbit is of finite measure or even closed. This article thus provides
important generalizations on previously known results and opens ways to new
applications in number theory, two of which are briefly mentioned.

Cet article adapte les résultats de [RS09] (Geometric results on linear actions of reductive Lie groups for applications to homogeneous dynamics
R. Richard and Nimish A. Shah
Ergodic Theory Dynam. Systems, 2018) 
au cas d’un groupe algébrique semisimple \(G\) sur un corps local k muni d’une valeur absolue ultramétrique |−|.
Nous suivons, dans les grandes lignes, la méthode développée dans [RS09] pour
le contexte archimédien (dont nos Propositions 3.1 et 3.4 reprennent certains arguments). Pour pallier l’absence du théorème de décomposition de Mostow ([Mos55])
pour \(G(k)\) ainsi que la propriété de convexité de l’application exponentielle, qui n’est
plus partout définie, nous considérons le plongement \(\Theta : I_k(G) → G^{an}\) de l’immeuble
de Bruhat-Tits \(I_k(G)\) de \(G\) sur \(k\) dans l’espace analytique \(G^{an}\), au sens de Berkovich,
associé à \(G\).

Notre démonstration repose en effet sur le Théorème D.2 de l’annexe, qui se base
sur les travaux [RTW10] (Bertrand Rémy, Amaury Thuillier, and Annette Werner. Bruhat-Tits theory from Berkovich’s
point of view. I. Realizations and compactifications of buildings. Ann. Sci. Éc. Norm. Supér. (4),
43(3) :461–554, 2010.) de Bertrand Rémy, Amaury Thuillier et Anette Werner. Ces
auteurs généralisent une construction du chapitre 5 de [Ber90] (Vladimir G. Berkovich. Spectral theory and analytic geometry over non-Archimedean fields, volume 33 of Mathematical Surveys and Monographs. American Mathematical Society, Providence,
RI, 1990.
), où V. Berkovich se restreint aux groupes de Chevalley (semi-simples déployés). Le Théorème D.2 met à profit
les propriétés de convexité dans \(I_k(G)\), et remplace la propriété de convexité de l’application exponentielle de [RS09] par la convexité de fonctions de la forme 
\(x\mapsto \lvert f(x) \rvert\) (Proposition 3.6) lorsque \(f\) est dans \(k[G]\), une fonction régulière.
La décomposition de Mostow est remplacée par la décomposition moins précise du
Théorème D.1 et sa conséquence en la Proposition 2.1. Pour obtenir l’énoncé 2.1, notre
démonstration utilise l’existence de points fixes pour l’action de groupes d’isométries
compacts sur les immeubles de Bruhat-Tits. Ces propriétés découlent de l’existence
de métriques hyperboliques, et justifient le choix de la géométrie ultramétrique au
sens de Berkovich, plutôt que rigide, qui permet de considérer des espaces métriques
complets.

Que Bertrand Remy, Amaury Thuillier et Georges Tomanov reçoivent ici mes remerciements pour leur accueil chaleureux et leur conversation enrichissante à l’occasion
de mon déplacement à l’institut Camille Jordan de l’université Lyon 1 Claude Bernard.
C’est en côtoyant, à l’IRMAR, Antoine Chambert-Loir, Antoine Ducros et Jérôme
Poineau que j’ai pu me familiariser avec les espaces de Berkovich. Que cet article leur
témoigne de ma reconnaissance.

C’est la relecture par Emmanuel Breuillard qui a conduit à l’erratum.

In this article, we show how, along the lines of [EMS97], to combine

(1) application of Dani-Margulis linearisation method, in the form given by D. Kleinbock and G. Tomanov in [KT07] (“Flows on S-arithmetic homogeneous spaces
and applications to metric Diophantine approximation”, Comment. Math. Helv. 82
(2007), no. 3, p. 519–581.);
(2) with the geometric results of [RS09b] (“On narrowness for S-arithmetic translates”, Exposé VI de “ Sur quelques
questions d’équidistribution en géométrie arithmétique” (2009).) and [Ric09d] (“On narrowness for S-arithmetic translates”, Exposé VI de “ Sur quelques
questions d’équidistribution en géométrie arithmétique” (2009).) (or rather their combination in Theorem 5)
in order to prove a more general and precise variant of the main result of [EMS97] (A. Eskin, S. Mozes & N. Shah – “Non-divergence of translates of certain algebraic
measures”, Geom. Funct. Anal. 7 (1997), no. 1, p. 48–80.)
encompassing the \(S\)-arithmetic setup (Theorem 1, 2 and 3 below). In particular,
together with [RS09b] and [KT07], this article contains a complete alternative
proof of the main result of [EMS97].
The result from [KT07] that we will use is a consequence of [KT07] Theorem 9.3 which is slightly more general than an application that [KT07] already
worked out, namely Theorem 9.4. In order to obtain this generalisation we will
need to check that the lemmas from [KT07] allow to apply results from [KT07]
to the case we consider. This is done in section 3 and 5. Section 4 recalls some
of the notations of [KT07] that we will use in order to express how we will use
Theorems 9.3 and 9.4 of [KT07].
The results established concern non-divergence of certain sequences of translated measures. They are generalised in [RZb] which determines the limits of such
sequences. Nonetheless the reference [RZb] relies on the non-divergence proved
here.},
