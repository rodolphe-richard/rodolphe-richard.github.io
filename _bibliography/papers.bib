The problem we are interested in is an analogue of [3] ("Répartition galoisienne d’une classe d’isogénie de courbes elliptiques", C. R. Math. Acad. Sci. Paris, Volume 347 (2009) no. 3-4, pp. 123-127) and of [4] ("Répartition galoisienne d’une classe d’isogénie de courbes elliptiques", Int. J. Number Theory, Volume 09 (2013) no. 02, pp. 517-543), itself an analogue of [2] (William Drexel Duke Hyperbolic distribution problems and half-integral weight Maass forms, Invent. Math., Volume 92 (1988) no. 1, pp. 73-90). It is about “galoisian” equidistribution of an isogeny class of elliptic curves, in the modular curve, but at an ultrametric place. We answer here in the case of non ultrametric invariants: these of elliptic curves with bad reduction. The way chosen here is quantitative through a link with Dirichlet series of Eisenstein series. We show in the end how to apply the equidistribution property to the asymptotic of the local height of the values of modular functions 
\(P\in\mathbb{Q}(j)\) along a isogeny class, under some hypothesis on the poles of \(P\).

We leave the treatment of poles of \(P\) and of an inverse problem, equivalence between heights asymptotic and equidistribution, to a later article. As the case of elliptic curves with good reduction.

Given a number field \(K\), a finite abelian group \(G\)

 with Galois group \(G\)
 that realise all of the elements \(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_t\)
 as norms of elements in \(L\).
In particular, this shows existence of such extensions for any given parameters.

Our approach relies on class field theory and a recent formulation of Tate’s characterisation of the Hasse norm principle, a local-global principle for norms. The constructions are sufficiently explicit to be implemented on a computer, and we illustrate them with concrete examples.},

We also indicate a procedure to palliate the lack of isomorphy of this comparison. We establish by the way a characterisation of soluble equations up to equivalence on the dagger algebra.

Our object is the theory of “\(\pi\)-exponentials” Pulita developed in his thesis, generalising Dwork's and Robba's exponentials and extending Matsuda's work:

We start with an abstract algebra statement about the structure of the kernel of iterations of the Frobenius endomorphism on the ring of Witt vectors with coordinates in the ring of integers of an ultrametric extension of \(\mathbf{Q}_p\). 
Provided sufficiently (ramified) roots of unity are available, it is, unexpectedly simply, a principal ideal with respect to an explicit generator essentially given by Pulita's \(\pi\)-exponential. This result is a consequence and a reformulation of core facts of Pulita's theory. It happened to be simpler to prove directly than reformulating Pulita's results.

Its translation in terms of series is very elementary, and gives a criterion for solvabilty and integrality for \(p\)-adic exponential series of polynomials. We explain how to deduce an explicit formula of their radius of convergence, and even the function radius of convergence. We recover this way, in elementary terms, with a new proof, and important simplifications, an algorithm of Christol based similarly on Pulita's work. One concrete advantage is: one can easily prove rigorous complexity bounds about the implied algorithm from our explicit formula. We also add there and there refinements and observation, notably hinting some of the finer informations that can also given by the algorithm.

One of the appendix produce a computation which gives finer estimates on the coefficients of these series. It should provide useful in proving complexity bounds for various computational use involving these series. It is not apparent yet in the present work, but should be in latter projected developments, the series under consideration are the base object for some exponential sums on finite fields via p-adic approach, namely via rigid cohomology with rank one coefficients.

Convergence radius and coefficients estimates are involved studying the efficiency of computational implementations of these objects. The understanding of convergence radius of \(p\)-adic differential equations is a subject undergoing active developments, and we here provide a fine theoretical and computational study of the simplest of cases.

This initiate a projected series of articles. We start here, with the case of the affine line as a base space, a Witt vectors paradigm. This provides an alternative purely algebraic approach of Pulita's theory; the richness of Witt vectors theory allow suppleness and efficiency in working with \(\pi\)-exponentials, which will prove efficient later in the series.
